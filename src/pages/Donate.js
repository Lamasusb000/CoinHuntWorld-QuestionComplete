                Currently the team is just a 20 year old college student named Junior (MrTurtlesGame) who writes all the code and a few friends on the internet who help him along his way who he would not be here without.

                History Behind CHW Trivia
            </h3>
            <p className="Indent2">
                This Website started as a way to quickly research question given within the Game but quickly evolved into a community that strives to collect every datapoint we can through our streamline data collection process

                Why You should donate
            </h3>
            <p className="Indent2">
                My (Junior's) Ultimate goal was to create a community resource that would allow people to have access to data that has real monetary value to assist others with their challenges. 
            </p>
            <p className="Indent2">
                Along with my friends we wanted to make the tool before someone else could so we could make what is best for the community which includes our free APIs non-Ad driven website all of which are unfortunately... Not free
            </p>
            <p className="Indent2">
                in order to prevent CHW Trivia being forced to either shut down/ start serving ads to our viewers the site is going to be dependent on Donations. Speaking for myself and what I can assume many others... People hate Ads and if the site becomes forced to serve them to stay alive it would only become another nail in the coffin
