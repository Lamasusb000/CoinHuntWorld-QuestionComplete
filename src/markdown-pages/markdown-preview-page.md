#### CMS Page Creation

1. Rich Text Editor

   * Designed more towards a common user
   * Simple and Easy to use
   * Converted into Markdown after publishing
2. Markdown

   * Designed more towards more experience computer users
   * Requires memorization of inline code such as 1-6 # of header levels or enclosing \*\* for bold text and so on

#### Page Creation

After creating a page the site will re-compile its code and generate a new page from the Markdown code and uses the URL identifier (Slug) to create a URL from the base directory
